# pgweb

This repository simply contains a Dockerfile to build an ARM-compatible image for [pgweb](https://github.com/sosedoff/pgweb), because the image at [hub.docker.io/r/sosedoff/pgweb](https://hub.docker.com/r/sosedoff/pgweb) does not run on a Raspberry Pi.

## Pre-built image

A pre-built image for running pgweb on ARM platforms is available for use on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.io/r/teapow/pgweb).
